# Personal Portfolio
The Personal Portfolio project was built as part of Free Code Camp's Basic Front-end Development Projects. 
It displays a brief intro about myself, some of the projects I have worked on, as well as some links to contact me.

### Note: The project is outdated and my an up-to-date portfolio can be found [here](http://www.nimalen.com/portfolio.html).
