# Twitch Streams
The Twitch Streams project was built as part of Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front-end Development Projects. It lets you get the status of a certain channels already specified, including online, offline, and inactive, and takes you to their channels. I used the Twitch TV API, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.
