# Local Weather App
The Local Weather App project was built as part of Free Code Camp's Intermediate Front-end Development Projects. 
It displays the weather (temperature and conditions) in both Fahrenheit and Celsius for you at your current location using the Open Weather API and IP API for quicker access to your location.
